    <th> A net shot can lead to a very tense rally of shots as it can go back and forth until either someone hits the perfect shot that just falls over the net, or until someone lifts.
        A perfectly hit net shot can be nigh impossible to return, as if your opponent hits the net in attempting to return the shot, it's your point.
        Net shots can also lead to a poor lift from your opponent, which will let you win the point with a smash.

<th> To hit a net shot, you will want to be standing by the service line, with your dominant hand side leg in front, as to maximise your reach.
    you will want to have your arm out stretched, with your palm facing upwards. 
    When the shuttle is near enough, you'll want to flick your wrist and twist your arm slightly at the same.
    Do this too soft and the shuttle will go into the net.
    Do it too hard and you'll have set your opponent up for an easy smash.

    </tr>
    <th> Net shots are much, much easier on your forehand, but don't think aiming for your opponents backhand will be a free point,
        as if you hit the shuttle to their backhand they will most likely return the shot with a lift instead of a net shot,
        but if you're ready for that, this can work in your favour.

    <th> A lift is a shot that is mostly used defensively against net shots.
        If you feel as though your opponent has the upperhand when it comes to rallies that are close to the net, 
        you can send them running to the back of the court by lifting the shuttle over their head.
        This can somewhat reset the momentum of the game and put both players onto a more even footing.

<th> To do a lift, you'll need to have your palm facing up, your dominant hand side foot forward, standing by the service line.
    You'll want to flick your wrist upwards, and hit the shuttle before your racket is pointing straight ahead of you.
    Hitting the shuttle too early will send it high, but not far, letting your opponent smash the shuttle back at you.
    Hitting too late will either hit the shuttle into the net, or, if the shuttle does manage to get over the net, it will send it too far and it will land out, 
    which, unless your opponent mistakenly hits it, will cost you the point.

    <th> Lifts are done to send your opponent to the back of the court, so the back place to aim a lift is to get it to the back of the court.
        Hitting the shuttle diagonally from where you are is your best bet as it means your opponent will have to cover the most amount of ground in order to get to it.
