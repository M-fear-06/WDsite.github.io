    <th> The low backhand serve is probably the most popular type of serve in competitive badminton, and for good reason. 
        A well placed shot can very easily score you a point from either your opponent missing or your opponent returning the shuttle poorly.
        The serves popularity can be a double-edged sword, however, as if your opponent is expecting it, they can quickly step forward and smash the shot as it goes over the net.
        Mixing up it will make your serves less predictable and keep your opponent guessing, the less your opponent is expecting you to serve short, the more likely you are to score.

<th> Similarly to the high backhand serve, you'll be standing with your dominant hand side leg behind you and your other leg in front.
    After hitting the shuttle, I would recommend waiting to see if your opponent lifts or netshots in response.
    If they netshot, step forward, if they lift, jump back.

    <th> If your opponent's racket is on the outside, you can hit the shuttle nearly straight from where you're standing, to just go over their shoulder behind them.
        This shot will most likely not work if they're holding their racket on the inside, as you'll be serving right into a smash.

        A high backhand serve or a "flick" as it is usually called, is similar to the forehand low serve, being that is it can very good at throwing off your opponent.
        A backhand serve usually indicates a low serve, so a high serve to the back of the court can lead to an easy score if your opponent isn't expecting it.
        The drawback from this serve is that it is hard to get the shuttle as high as you can with a forehand long serve.
        if the serve is not high enough, your opponent will smash the shot right back at you, which is not what we want.

<th> you'll want to hold your racket out in front of you and point in downwards at 8 o' clock (4 o'clock if you're left handed). 
    you'll want to be leaning forward, your dominant hand side foot back and your other foot forward.
    When holding the shuttle, hold it by its feathers, with your index finger and thumb, pointing it towards your racket.
    To hit the shuttle, it's all in the wrist and elbow, you will have to flick your wrist towards the shuttle, following through with your arm.
    The difference with this serve is you'll be hitting the shuttle harder, and instead of staying near the net after the serve, you'll want to take a step back after serving.
    This is so if your opponent decides to return the shot with a clear, you can be ready to move back and hit the shot.

    <th> You will want to aim this shot to the very back of the court, preferably onto your opponents backhand, as overhead shots are much harder on your backhand.
        If done correctly, you should win the point with ease.
