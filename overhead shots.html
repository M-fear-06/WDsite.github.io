        A dropshot is a very important shot to know how to do as it is very different from clears and smashs.
        This is because it hits the shuttle to the front of the court, by the net, meaning your opponent has to be ready to go forward and hit back.
        The setup for this shot is nearly identical to how you would do a smash, so you can fake out your opponent with this shot if they're expecting a smash.

<th> To do a dropshot, you'll need to have your racket held high, with it starting behind your back. 
    Your arm should be over your shoulder and your wrist should be bent.
    Within thr arc that your racket will do when you swing, you want to hit the shuttle as your racket starts to go down.
    When the shuttle is near enough, you'll want to swing, hard enough to get it over the net but not much more.
    After you've done this, you'll want to move forward as your opponent could tap the shuttle back with a netshot and you'll need to be ready should that happen.

    <th> As always, aiming your shot to your opponents backhand will aways be better than aiming to their forehand, 
        but there might be times where you're better off aiming straght to your opponents forehand rather than diagonally into your opponent's backhand.

    <th> The smash is easily the most feared shot in all of badminton. 
        This is due to its fast downward speed and how often its used to win points.
        If your opponent does a poor lift or clear that sends the shuttle high but close to the front or middle of the court, a smash can take advantage of this mistake and win you the point.
        Smashing can be very tempting whenever you see a high shot, but a unneeded smash can cost you the point if done in the wrong place.

<th>  For a smash, you'll want to hit the shuttle at a similar time in the arc of your swing as when you're hitting a drop shot, which is as your racket starts to face downwards, but you'll be hitting the shuttle much harder.
To maximise the strength of your shot, you'll want to step forward as you swing to turn your hips, adding to your momentum.
Just like all overhead shots, you'll want your racket behind you, your arm over your shoulder and your dominant hand side leg behind your other leg.

        A Smash is powerful enough in and of itself that as long as you aren't launching your shot into the net, where the shot lands isn't too important. 
        However, as always, strong smash to your opponents backhand can lead to a poor return from them.

    <th> A clear is a classic badminton shot and is probably what you think of when you think about badminton.
        A clear is a shot that will the shuttle to the very back of the court, it is also very commonly used to respond to another clear.
        Getting your opponent to the back of the court can be very useful, especially if you can follow it up with a low shot like a drop or net shot.
        A clear may seem like an easy shot to pull off but a poorly hit clear can result in your oppoent smashing the shot back at you, which is not optimal.

<th>  To do a clear, you will need to hit the shuttle just as the racket gets to the peak of its arc.
    Hitting too early in the swing will not send the shuttle far enough, resulting in an easy smash for your opponent.
    Hitting too late in the swing will not send the shuttle high enough and the shuttle will go into the net.
    However, hit it at the right time and you can send your opponent to the back of the court to try and hit the shot back.
    This can set up nicely for a netshot.

    <th> You will want to avoid aiming for the middle of the court with this shot as that will be the easiest place for your opponent to get to.
        Instead aim for either corner of the court to keep your opponent as far away as possible from wherever your next shot will be to.
