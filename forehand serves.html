    <th> A low forehand serve is a good way to start a point as it can throw off your opponent. 
        Forehand serves are usually done to long to the back of the court, so serving to the front can throw them off, resulting in an easy score for you.
    This works better in singles matches, as the back boundary line is in for singles serves, meaning your opponent has to be wary of a long serve to the back.</th>

<th> To do a forehand low serve, you'll need to put dominate hand side leg back, and your other leg forward.
    You can then bring your racket back, with your wrist facing the ground and your arm straight out. 
    You should have your front foot on its heel, so you can put it down as you swing to maximise your momentum in the swing. 
    The shuttle should be held in front of you by its head, so that when you drop it it will fall into the part of the arc of the swing that sends it forward.
    As with all low serves, should your opponent return the shot, it will most likely be with a lift or a net shot. 
    You can move to the middle of the court right after serving to be ready for this.

    </tr>
    <th> You'll want to aim this shot so that it just goes over the net while still landing in your opponents serving box, giving them minimal chance to return. 
        You are best off aiming on the side of your opponents non-racket hand, which will force them to return the shot with their backhand.

    <th> A high forehand serve will send your opponent to the back of the court to respond with an overhead shot.
        A poorly done high forehand serve, aka, the shuttle goes high, but not far into the back of the court, will be smashed back at you, which is not favourable.
        However, if the serve is done well, your opponent will most likely hit either a dropshot or a clear, being ready for either can put you in a much better position than your opponent.

<th> To do a high forehand serve, you'll need to put dominate hand side leg back, and your other leg forward. 
    You'll need to hold the shuttle with your index finger and thumb, holding it just above your eyeline.
     Put your weight on your backfoot and hold your racket behind you, with your wrist bent so the racket is pointing upwards.
     To hit the shuttle, you'll want to shift your weight onto your front foot just as you drop the shuttle and swing, putting more momentum into the swing.
     Should your opponent hit the shot back they will most likely hit an overhead shot. 
     Be ready for this by moving to the center of the court, or by being side by side with your partner if its doubles.

    <th> You will want to aim this shot to the very back of the court, preferably onto your opponents backhand, as overhead shots are much harder on your backhand.
        If done correctly, you should win the point with ease.
